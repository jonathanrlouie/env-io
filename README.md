# Env-IO

## What is Env-IO?

Env-IO is a highly experimental, work-in-progress, functional effect system for Rust that is inspired by the [ZIO library](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-zio) for Scala.
Specifically, it is based on ZIO environments, as described in [this article](http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment).

## What is the point of this?

I wrote this for fun and because I wanted to learn more about Rust's traits. It also allows me experiment with the
various properties of functional effect systems in Rust.
